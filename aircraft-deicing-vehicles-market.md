<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Deicing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-propelled</li><li>Towed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft deicing vehicles are essential for maintaining flight safety during winter conditions. The market is categorized into two main types: self-propelled and towed deicing vehicles. Self-propelled deicing vehicles are equipped with their own propulsion system, allowing for greater maneuverability and efficiency in applying deicing fluids directly to aircraft. In contrast, towed deicing vehicles rely on another vehicle for mobility, making them generally more cost-effective but less versatile. Both types are designed to ensure aircraft are free of ice and snow before takeoff.</p></p>
